So this is a very simple app that takes the titles of the most recent Reddit news depending the category you selected. 
The only options are mexico and videogames since the main focus of this little project is to find the most effective way to consume services from the Reddit API. 
I uploaded already a repo with the exact same app but this time I went ahead and used Alamofire and got impressed of the simplicity of it. 
Hope you enjoy it :)
